This project creates a local Vagrant-based ÂµMEC installation that works at
least with the libvirt provider. In other words, start the server in
directory "server" with 

    sudo vagrant --provider=libvirt up

The current version works with Arch Linux since that is what I am most
familiar with. OpenSUSE is planned next.

The directory ./data is mounted to the Vagrant machines. /data/cache has
cached files, such as Arch Linux packages and k3s+helm installers. The
script 

    ./setup.sh 

will download what (might) be needed. This will just speed up booting,
the provisioning script will download what is needed. 

Only the server is ready now.
